      		<p class="txt1">Logic Programming (LP), which provides languages for declarative problem solving and symbolic reasoning, has started gaining more attention in terms of building explainable learning models. Symbolic logic has traditionally been the preferred form of LP representation for decades due to its usefulness in problemsolving and reasoning. Over time, researchers have developed dedicated solvers and effective tools for Answer Set Programming (ASP) a form of LP that uses stable model semantics. Additionally, some researchers are exploring the connection between logical inference and numerical computation in mixed integer programming, which provides a new approach for efficient implementations.<br>
      		 <br>Some researchers are now exploring ways to convert logical inference into numerical computation by leveraging connections between logical inference and mathematical computation. This approach offers a promising way to implement LP more efficiently. Numerous studies have explored the embedding of logic programs into numerical spaces and leveraging algebraic characteristics. There are several reasons why linear algebraic computation of LP should be considered.<br><br>
      		 Starting in 2017, Sakama et al. introduced the concept of linearizing the characteristics of a logic program by using matrix multiplication for deductive reasoning. The basic idea is to convert a logic program into a matrix and then perform the TP-operator in vector spaces by matrix-vector multiplication.  This research aims to investigate linear algebraic approaches for LP in all three forms of reasoning (deduction, abduction, and induction) in order to build a general framework for logic reasoning in the language of linear algebra.</p></li>
